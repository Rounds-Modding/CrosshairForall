# Crosshair For All
-------------------

Adds a crosshair for controller players as well as the option to add crosshairs to enemy players.

Crosshairs can be white, or match the color of their player. You can change these settings (which will save between game sessions) via the F1 mod menu in-game.

## Crosshair Control
--------------------

Crosshairs for controller players can be controlled via the left- and right-stick buttons (L3/R3) three control schemes are available in the F1 menu. They are:

- None: crosshairs are a fixed distance from the player
- Stepped: press R3 to switch between discrete distances from the player
- Smooth: hold R3 to move the crosshair away or L3 to move it closer

## Projectile Speed
-------------------

Crosshairs for both controller players and enemy players can have their distance automatically adjusted based on that character's projectile speed stat. These settings can be enabled/disabled through the F1 mod menu.
